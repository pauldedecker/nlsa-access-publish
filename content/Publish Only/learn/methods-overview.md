# Methods Overview

The Accessibility Project uses a mixed-methods, community-engaged research design. Our approach prioritizes:

- Lived experience as expertise  
- Ethical collaboration  
- Accessibility as both a method and an outcome  
- Transparency across all stages of research  

The project unfolds in multiple phases:

1. A province-wide survey  
2. Semi-structured interviews  
3. Community meetings and workshops  
4. Knowledge mobilization through media, events, and public engagement  

Each phase informs the next, allowing the project to remain responsive to community needs.
