# Community Workshops

Community workshops are a central part of the Accessibility Project. These workshops create shared spaces for people who stutter (PWS), families, educators, clinicians, and community partners to come together, learn from one another, and collectively imagine more communicatively accessible communities in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Rather than treating accessibility as a technical problem to be solved by experts alone, the workshops are designed as **collaborative spaces** where lived experience, professional knowledge, and community insight all carry equal weight.

## What Happens in a Workshop?

Each workshop is structured around three core goals:

### 1. **Listening to Lived Experience**
Participants hear directly from people who stutter about:
- Navigating healthcare, education, and public life  
- Experiences of stigma, misunderstanding, and support  
- What accessibility feels like in everyday interaction  

### 2. **Understanding Communication as Accessibility**
We explore:
- Communication differences as part of human diversity  
- How institutions often privilege fluency and speed  
- How everyday interactional norms can unintentionally exclude  

### 3. **Building Local Strategies**
Together, we:
- Identify concrete barriers in local contexts  
- Share existing community strengths  
- Co-design small, realistic changes that improve accessibility
