# Ethics & Values

This project is grounded in ethical, collaborative, and justice-oriented research practices.

Our work is guided by:

- **TCPS2 ethical principles**  
- **Community-based research frameworks**  
- **Disability justice perspectives**  
- **Dialogic approaches to communication**  

People who stutter are not positioned as research “subjects,” but as:

- Partners  
- Co-researchers  
- Knowledge holders  

We treat accessibility not as an accommodation added later, but as a core research principle from the outset.
