# Who We Are

This project is a collaboration among:

- **People who stutter (PWS)**
- **Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association (NLSA)**
- **Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN)**
- **Educators, clinicians, policymakers, and community allies**

Our team is committed to ethical, community-engaged, and accessible research.  
We combine sociolinguistics, disability studies, lived experience, and qualitative research methods to build a more inclusive province for people who communicate differently.
