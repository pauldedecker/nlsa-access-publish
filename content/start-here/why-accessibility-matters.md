# Why Accessibility Matters in Newfoundland and Labrador

People who stutter (PWS) often face structural, communicative, and attitudinal barriers across health services, schools, workplaces, and public life.

In Newfoundland and Labrador, accessibility gaps are shaped by:

- Limited public speech-language pathology services  
- Uneven access across rural and urban regions  
- Cultural narratives surrounding communication and fluency  
- A lack of policy frameworks that include communication disability  

Understanding these barriers is essential to building a province where PWS can participate fully, be heard, and experience dignity in communication.

This project places PWS at the centre of the conversation, using collaborative and justice-oriented research practices.
