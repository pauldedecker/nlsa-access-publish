# What This Project Is

The Accessibility Project is a multi-stage research and community-engagement initiative focused on identifying and removing barriers to full participation for people who stutter (PWS) in Newfoundland and Labrador. 

We are building a coalition across health care, education, community groups, and lived-experience advocates to understand:

- Where accessibility gaps exist  
- How PWS navigate services and communication environments  
- What supports are missing  
- How communities can become more inclusive  

This site provides an evolving, transparent view into the research process, our methods, our partners, and the outcomes of this work.
