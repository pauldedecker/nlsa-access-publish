# Survey

The project begins with a province-wide survey designed to assess:

- Access to speech-language pathology services  
- Barriers to participation  
- Experiences in schools, healthcare, and workplaces  
- Community and policy gaps  

The survey is open to:

- People who stutter  
- Family members  
- Clinicians  
- Educators  
- Community stakeholders  

Findings from the survey guide the interview phase and the community meetings.
