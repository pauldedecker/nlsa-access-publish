# Interviews

Semi-structured interviews form the second phase of the project.

Interviews explore:

- Personal communication histories  
- Encounters with healthcare and education  
- Experiences of stigma and support  
- Navigating public life as a person who stutters  

Interviews are conducted using accessible, participant-centred protocols. Participants control:

- Pacing  
- Question selection  
- Modes of response  
- Levels of disclosure
